# BioBaler Pro (with VPW!)
Why do the pallets only spawn on one layer? NO LONGER! This script mod solves the issue of not enough pallets being able to be spawned in any (base-game or mod) production or husbandry spawn point!

### From the ModDesc

>
> AND... If that wasn't enough, this mod also adds in Variable Pickup Width (VPW) support, which adds a custom workMode allowing you to select from 4 different pickup widths:
> - Default Pickup (default)
