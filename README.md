# BioBaler Pro (with VPW!)
No one likes baling poplar... because the bales are so small, the pickup on the baler is tiny, it's slow, and it creates a shit-ton of bales. I've fixed all of that by making it faster, making it support all the way up to 180 sized bales with much larger capacities, and even adding in Variable Pickup Width support. If that wasn't enough, I've added a COTTON version also, so you can actually harvest cotten without needing a crazy expensive harvester. You're welcome!
